# Unity Scene Setup Diagram

This diagram illustrates the components and structure of a Unity scene for robotics simulation:

## Main Components:
- **Main Camera**: Provides visualization of the robot and environment
- **Robot GameObject**: The simulated robot with kinematic structure
- **Lighting System**: Directional light and other light sources
- **Environment**: Ground plane, obstacles, and other scene elements

## Robotics-Specific Components:
- **Rigidbodies**: Physics-enabled components for each robot part
- **Articulation Bodies**: For realistic joint physics (in newer Unity versions)
- **Colliders**: Define collision boundaries for robot parts
- **Joints**: Define how robot parts connect and move relative to each other

## Sensor Components:
- **Cameras**: RGB and depth cameras for vision simulation
- **Raycast Sensors**: For LiDAR simulation
- **Inertial Measurement**: Scripts simulating IMU data
- **Actuators**: Components for simulating motor commands

## Integration Elements:
- **ROS Bridge**: Interface for communication with ROS/ROS2
- **Robot Controller Scripts**: Scripts for processing commands and publishing data
- **UI Elements**: For real-time visualization of robot state
- **Animation Controllers**: For complex robot movements
