# Unity Robot Scene Configuration

This file represents a conceptual Unity robot scene configuration that would typically be a binary .unity file.

## Robot Components:
- Robot Base: GameObject with Rigidbody and basic mesh
- Robot Arm: ArticulationBody components for realistic joint physics
- Sensors: Camera, LiDAR simulation, and IMU components
- Controllers: Scripts for robot control and ROS communication

## Physics Configuration:
- Gravity: Enabled, with standard Earth gravity (9.81 m/s²)
- Collision Detection: Continuous for fast-moving parts
- Solver Iterations: 12 (balance between accuracy and performance)
- Material: Custom PhysicMaterial with appropriate friction values

## Key Scripts:
- RobotController.cs: Main robot control script
- SensorSimulation.cs: Handles sensor simulation and data publishing
- ROSBridge.cs: Communication with ROS system

## Environment:
- Ground plane with standard PhysicMaterial
- Lighting setup for realistic rendering
- Occlusion areas for performance optimization

## Performance Settings:
- LOD (Level of Detail) for complex robot models
- Occlusion culling for large environments
- Dynamic batching for repeated objects
- Appropriate shadow settings balancing quality and performance
