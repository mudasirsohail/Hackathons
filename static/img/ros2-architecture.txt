# ROS 2 Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates the key components and communication patterns in ROS 2:

## Components:
- Nodes: Individual executables that use ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes
- Topics: Communication channels over which nodes exchange messages
- Services: Request-response communication pattern between nodes
- Actions: Goal-oriented communication with feedback and result
- Parameters: Configuration values that nodes can store and retrieve
- Message interfaces: Definitions of the data structures used in communication

## Architecture:
- Client Libraries (rclpy, rclcpp) that allow different languages to interface with ROS 2
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) as the middleware providing underlying communication
- ROS Graph showing how nodes are connected and communicate
- Launch system for managing complex systems of nodes
- Tools like rviz and rqt for visualization and interaction

This architecture enables a distributed system where multiple processes and potentially multiple machines can coordinate to perform complex robotic tasks.
