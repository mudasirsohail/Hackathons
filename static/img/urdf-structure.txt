# URDF Structure Diagram

This diagram illustrates the components and structure of a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file:

## Key Elements:
- Robot Element: The root element with robot name and necessary xmlns
- Links: Rigid, unmovable parts of the robot with:
  - Visual: How the link appears (geometry, material, origin)
  - Collision: Collision properties (geometry, origin)
  - Inertial: Mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor
- Joints: Connections between links with:
  - Joint type (fixed, revolute, continuous, prismatic, etc.)
  - Parent and child links
  - Origin (position and orientation of joint)
  - Axis of rotation or translation
  - Joint limits (for revolute/prismatic joints)
  - Dynamics properties

## Typical Structure:
- Single base_link that defines the root of the kinematic chain
- Multiple connected links via joints forming kinematic chains
- Material definitions for visual appearance
- Common fixed joints for mounting sensors or other components

## Example Applications:
- Robot arm with multiple revolute joints
- Mobile robot with continuous wheel joints
- Humanoid robot with complex kinematic chains for arms and legs
- Sensor mountings using fixed joints
