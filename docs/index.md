# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed for beginners to intermediate learners who want to understand the fundamentals of robotics, AI integration, and humanoid systems.

## About This Book

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules, each covering critical aspects of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

### [Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/modules/module-1-robotic-nervous-system)
Focuses on middleware for robot control, covering ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services, bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy, and understanding URDF for humanoids.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/modules/module-2-digital-twin)
Covers physics simulation and environment building, including simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo, high-fidelity rendering in Unity, and simulating various sensors like LiDAR and IMUs.

### [Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/modules/module-3-ai-robot-brain)
Focuses on advanced perception and training using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM, and Nav2 for path planning for bipedal movement.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/modules/module-4-vision-language-action)
Covers the convergence of LLMs and Robotics, including voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions, and the capstone Autonomous Humanoid project.

## Learning Approach

This book follows the principles of hands-on learning. Each lesson includes practical examples, exercises, and projects that you can implement. Theory is always demonstrated through code, simulations, or real-world applications to ensure beginners can follow along and intermediate learners can deepen their understanding through practice.

## Getting Started

Start with Module 1 if you're new to robotics, or jump to the module that best fits your current knowledge level. Each module is designed to be modular, allowing you to learn independently, but building on concepts introduced in earlier modules for a comprehensive understanding.
