# Integration Examples

## Overview
This lesson provides concrete examples of how to integrate all the components you've learned about. You'll see how to combine voice recognition, LLM planning, perception, navigation, and manipulation in complete robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Design complete robotic systems combining multiple technologies
- Implement integration patterns between different subsystems
- Handle real-time coordination of multiple robot capabilities
- Build fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation
- Design user interfaces for multimodal robot control

## System Architecture
Learn architectural patterns for connecting:
- Voice recognition (Whisper)
- Natural language processing (LLMs)
- Perception systems (Vision, LIDAR)
- Planning systems (Nav2)
- Manipulation systems
- Low-level controllers

## Integration Patterns
- Event-driven architectures
- Message passing between components
- State management across subsystems
- Error propagation and recovery

## Practical Examples
- Voice-controlled robot navigation
- Multimodal object identification and manipulation
- Natural language task decomposition
- Safety interlocks across subsystems

## Best Practices
- Modular design for easier debugging
- Comprehensive logging for system monitoring
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Performance optimization across subsystems

## Practical Exercise
Implement a scenario combining voice recognition, LLM planning, and robot control to accomplish a complex task like "Bring me the red cup from the kitchen".

## Next Steps
After exploring integration examples, you'll work on the [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](./lesson-4-capstone-autonomous-humanoid) project.
