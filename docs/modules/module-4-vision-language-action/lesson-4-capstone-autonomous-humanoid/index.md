# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

## Overview
The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course. You'll create a comprehensive system where a simulated humanoid robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate all course components into a complete system
- Implement a voice-controlled humanoid robot operation
- Combine VSLAM, path planning, and bipedal locomotion
- Design robust error handling and recovery
- Evaluate the complete autonomous system

## Project Components
The complete system will include:
- Voice command recognition using Whisper
- Natural language processing with LLMs
- Environment perception and mapping
- Path planning for navigation
- Bipedal locomotion control
- Object recognition and manipulation
- Safety and error handling

## System Architecture
- High-level task planning from voice commands
- Mid-level path planning and navigation
- Low-level motion control
- Perception for environment awareness
- Action execution and monitoring

## Implementation Steps
1. **Voice Command Processing**: Recognize and interpret natural language commands
2. **Task Planning**: Convert commands into sequences of robot actions
3. **Environment Perception**: Map and perceive the environment
4. **Path Planning**: Plan safe paths around obstacles
5. **Locomotion Control**: Execute bipedal walking to reach goals
6. **Object Manipulation**: Identify and manipulate specific objects
7. **System Integration**: Coordinate all subsystems for seamless operation

## Evaluation Criteria
- Successful completion of end-to-end tasks
- Robustness to environmental variations
- Error handling and recovery capabilities
- Performance efficiency
- Safety considerations

## Final Steps
After completing this capstone project, you'll have comprehensive knowledge of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, having implemented a complete autonomous humanoid robot system.

Congratulations on completing the course!
