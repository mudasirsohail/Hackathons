# NVIDIA Isaac Sim

## Overview
This lesson introduces NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a comprehensive simulation environment for robotics development. You'll learn to create photorealistic simulation environments and generate synthetic data for training AI systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Create photorealistic environments for robotics testing
- Generate synthetic data for AI training
- Configure lighting, materials, and environmental conditions
- Integrate with Omniverse for collaborative simulation

## What is NVIDIA Isaac Sim?
NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a robotics simulator built on NVIDIA Omniverse, providing high-fidelity physics simulation and photorealistic rendering capabilities. It's designed for developing, testing, and validating AI-based robotics applications.

## Key Features
- High-fidelity physics simulation leveraging NVIDIA PhysX
- Photorealistic rendering with NVIDIA RTX technology
- Synthetic data generation with ground truth annotations
- Integration with Isaac ROS and other robotics frameworks
- Scalable cloud deployment options

## Synthetic Data Generation
Isaac Sim excels at generating large amounts of labeled training data that would be difficult or expensive to collect in the real world, accelerating AI development.

## Practical Exercise
Set up Isaac Sim, import a robot model, create a photorealistic environment, and generate synthetic sensor data.

## Next Steps
After exploring Isaac Sim, you'll learn about [Isaac ROS VSLAM](./lesson-2-isaac-ros-vslam).
