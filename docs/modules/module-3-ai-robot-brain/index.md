# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
This module focuses on advanced perception and training. You'll learn about NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation, and Nav2 for path planning for bipedal humanoid movement.

## Learning Objectives
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Generate synthetic data for training robotics systems
- Implement Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Apply Nav2 for path planning, particularly for bipedal humanoid movement
