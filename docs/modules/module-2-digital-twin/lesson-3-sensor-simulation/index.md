# Sensor Simulation

## Overview
This lesson covers simulating various robot sensors in both Gazebo and Unity environments. Accurate sensor simulation is crucial for developing and testing perception algorithms before deployment on real robots.

## Learning Objectives
- Simulate LiDAR sensors with realistic noise and range characteristics
- Configure depth cameras for 3D perception in simulation
- Implement IMU sensors for orientation and acceleration data
- Set up GPS and other environmental sensors
- Validate sensor data against expected physical properties

## Sensor Types in Simulation
- **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging sensors for 2D/3D mapping
- **Depth Cameras**: RGB-D sensors for 3D scene reconstruction
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Units for orientation and motion
- **GPS**: Global Positioning System simulation for outdoor navigation
- **Force/Torque**: Sensors for measuring interaction forces

## Simulation Considerations
- Noise modeling to match real sensor characteristics
- Update rates matching real hardware
- Field of view and range limitations
- Occlusion and environmental effects

## Practical Exercise
Set up a robot with multiple sensor types in a simulation environment and validate the sensor outputs under various conditions.

## Next Steps
After mastering sensor simulation, you'll learn about [Physics Modeling](./lesson-4-physics-modeling).
