# Gazebo Simulation Basics

## Overview
This lesson introduces you to Gazebo, a powerful physics simulator widely used in robotics. You'll learn to set up simulation environments, import models, and configure physics properties for accurate robot testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Install and configure Gazebo for robotics simulation
- Create basic simulation worlds with objects and terrain
- Configure physics properties like gravity, friction, and damping
- Import and position robot models in simulation
- Control simulation parameters and time stepping

## What is Gazebo?
Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator that provides realistic physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces. It's widely used in robotics research and development for testing algorithms before deploying to real robots.

## Key Features
- Physics simulation with multiple engines (ODE, Bullet, Simbody)
- High-fidelity graphics rendering
- Sensors simulation (cameras, lidar, IMU, GPS, etc.)
- Plugin system for custom functionality
- Integration with ROS/ROS 2

## Practical Exercise
Set up a basic simulation world with a ground plane, static objects, and a robot model. Configure basic physics parameters and run the simulation.
