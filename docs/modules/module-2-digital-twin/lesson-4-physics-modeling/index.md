# Physics Modeling

## Overview
This lesson covers configuring accurate physics models in simulation environments. Proper physics modeling ensures that simulated robots behave similarly to their real-world counterparts.

## Learning Objectives
- Configure mass, inertia, and center of mass properties
- Set up collision detection and response parameters
- Model contact dynamics including friction and restitution
- Implement joint dynamics with appropriate constraints and limits
- Validate physics behavior against real-world data

## Key Physics Parameters
- **Mass Properties**: Mass distribution and center of mass
- **Collision Shapes**: Simplified shapes for efficient collision detection
- **Inertial Properties**: How objects respond to applied forces
- **Joint Dynamics**: Constraints, limits, friction, and damping

## Collision Detection
Properly modeling collisions is essential for realistic robot behavior, especially during manipulation tasks or when navigating through environments.

## Contact Dynamics
Understanding friction, restitution (bounciness), and other contact properties is crucial for accurate simulation of robot-environment interactions.

## Practical Exercise
Configure the physics properties for a humanoid robot model, including mass distribution, collision shapes, and joint constraints, then validate the behavior.

## Next Steps
After mastering physics modeling, you'll move to Module 3: [AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](../../module-3-ai-robot-brain/lesson-1-nvidia-isaac-sim).
