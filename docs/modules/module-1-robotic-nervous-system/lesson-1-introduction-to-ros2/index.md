# Introduction to ROS 2

## Overview
Welcome to the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). This lesson introduces you to the core concepts, architecture, and advantages of ROS 2 over its predecessor, ROS 1.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the architecture and design principles of ROS 2
- Learn the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Grasp the concept of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware
- Set up your first ROS 2 workspace and environment

## What is ROS 2?
ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 while maintaining its flexibility and modularity. Key improvements include:
- Real-time support
- Deterministic behavior
- Multi-robot systems support
- Production deployment capabilities
- Enhanced security

## DDS Middleware
ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its underlying communication middleware, offering better real-time performance and more robust communication patterns.

## Key Concepts
- **Nodes**: Basic computational units that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Extended services with feedback and goal preemption

## Next Steps
