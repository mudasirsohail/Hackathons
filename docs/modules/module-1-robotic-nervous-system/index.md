# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module focuses on middleware for robot control. You'll learn about ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services, bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy, and understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- Implement Nodes, Topics, and Services communication
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Create and work with URDF models for humanoid robots
